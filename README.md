# Travel Destinations

A simple app to keep track of destinations I'd like to visit. Within next 5 years, say I have been to all continents. Would start with something easier like South America. Eventually trying Europe, then Asia(or before Europe?). Australia and Africa(where exactly? idk). And upon another trip to South America, take a boat from Argentina/Chile to Antarctica.

Wish me Luck!!
